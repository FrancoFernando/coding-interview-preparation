# 78. Subsets

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
All the numbers of nums are unique.

## Approach

Use DFS + backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of including or excluding each element.
Once an element is added to the current subset and the recursive call is done, the element is then removed.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n * 2^n) - there are 2^n possible subsets, generating each subset takes O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the recursion stack and current subset
