# 707. Design Linked List

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/)

## Problem Description

Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.

Implement the MyLinkedList class with methods: get, addAtHead, addAtTail, addAtIndex, deleteAtIndex.

## Approach

Implement a singly linked list with head, tail pointers and length tracking for O(1) operations where possible.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) for index-based operations, O(1) for head/tail operations
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
