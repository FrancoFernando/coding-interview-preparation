# Thinking Process 

Observe that the problem asks to check if the frequencies of the elements are unique and NOT if the elements are unique.
Use an hash table to count the frequencies and a hash set to check if there are duplicated frequencies.

# Complexity

* O(N) time to iterate through the numbers
* O(N) space for the hash table
