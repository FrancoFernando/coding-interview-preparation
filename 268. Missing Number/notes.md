# Thinking Process 

1. Similar to 645 (Set mismatch). The missing number can be solved using the difference between the sum without missing and the one with missing. In alternative it can be solved with xor. Since x^x=0, the xor of xor of all number without missing and the xor of all number with missing will let disappear all numbers except the missing one. 

# Complexity (approach 1)

* O(N) time
* O(1) space
