# Thinking Process 

Brute force is to copy the input sort the copy with a library function and compare one by one with the original input.
This takes O(NlogN).
Considering the contraints of the problem can be solved in O(N) with counting sort. The number of heights is small and the space complexity too.

# Complexity (approach 1)

* O(N) time to iterate through the input
* O(M) space where M are the possible heights.
