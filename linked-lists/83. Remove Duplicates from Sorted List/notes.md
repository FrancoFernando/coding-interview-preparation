# Description

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

# Process

Fast/slow pointer approach. 
Slow is the current node, fast is the next node.
When fast is diffferent from slow, append fast to slow.

Complexity

O(n) time, O(1) space
