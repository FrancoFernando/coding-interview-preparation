# Thinking Process 

1. The key observation is that for all the nuts except the first one the distance is tree-nut-tree.
   So the first one is important to minimize the total distance. The first nut to pick up is not the closest one (ERROR), but the one maximizing the difference between the path  tree->nut->tree and the path squirrel->nut->tree.

# Complexity (approach 1)

* O(N) time
* O(1) space
