# Thinking Process 

1. It is requested the average of each level, so this is clearly a BFS problem. Only thing to take into account is possible overflow
   if we do the sum with integers converting to double only when division for average is performed. Doing sum directly using double avoid this.

# Complexity (approach 1)

* O(N) time
* O(N) space
