# Thinking Process 

1. To have a valid expression the number of open ( shall be equal to the number of ). This mean that processing the string from left to right, the number of ( shall be always greater than number of ). Viceversa processing from right to left , the number of ) shall be always greater than number of (). Doing this will produce a valid expression removing the min number of parentheses.


# Complexity (approach 1)

* O(N) time, to process the string twice
* O(1) if we take out the output from the complexity.
