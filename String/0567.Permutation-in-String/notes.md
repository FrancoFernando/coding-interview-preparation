### Description

Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.

In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: true
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: false
 
Constraints:

1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 104
s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.

### Thinking Process

The brute force solution would be to find all permutations of s1 and compare them to all possible substrings s2 to see if theyâ€™re equal. The approach is not feasible for large strings because its time complexity would be factorial in the length of the string.

The key observation to find a better solution is that a string is a permutation of another string if both use the same characters with the same frequencies. With this in mind, the approach become straightforward:

* count the frequencies of the letters in s1

* run a sliding windows in s2 with the size of s1 and count the frequencies of the letters in the windows

* check if the frequencies of the letters in s1 and in the window are equal

### Complexity

* The time complexity is O(NA), where N is the size of s2 and A is the size of the alphabet
* The space complexity is O(A)
