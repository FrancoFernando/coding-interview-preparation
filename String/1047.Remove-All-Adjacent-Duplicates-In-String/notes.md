### Thinking process

The get the answer you need just to simulate the process. 
Insert the characters of the input string in the answer and if the last inserted character is equal to the current remove both.
A stack can simulate the behaviour, but it's not necessary to use one xplicitely.

### Complexity

* O(N) time
* O(1) space without explicit stack, O(N) with
