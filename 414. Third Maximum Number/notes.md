# Thinking Process 

Brute force is to sort the input and take the third maximum distinct value. Many ways to optimize to O(N). 
Using a sorted set or mantaining 3 distinct variables are the most streightforward.

# Complexity (sorted set)

* O(N) time to iterate through the input and insert in the sorted set
* O(1) space
