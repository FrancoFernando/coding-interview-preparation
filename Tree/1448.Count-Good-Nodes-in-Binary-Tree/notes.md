### Description

Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
Example 2:

Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.
 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5].
Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4].

### Thinking Process

A node x is good if the path from root to x is monotonically increasing.
So the best way to solve the problem is using dfs keeping the max along the path.
If the current value is not lower than the max the current node shall be counted.
Recursio do the rest.

### Complexity

* O(N) time to traverse all nodes
* O(N) space for recursion stack
