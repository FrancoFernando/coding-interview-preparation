# Thinking Process 

Brute force would be to use an extra array to copy elements, but it's required to do without extra memory.
The key observation is noticing that the final position of each element is shifted to the left by the number of elements equal to zeros already encountered.
 Same problem as 27. Remove elements.

# Complexity

* O(N) time to iterate through the array
* O(1) space
