# Description

You are part of a university admissions office and need to keep track of the kth highest test score from applicants in real-time. This helps to determine cut-off marks for interviews and admissions dynamically as new applicants submit their scores.

You are tasked to implement a class which, for a given integer k, maintains a stream of test scores and continuously returns the kth highest test score after a new score has been submitted. More specifically, we are looking for the kth highest score in the sorted list of all scores.

Implement the KthLargest class:

KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of test scores nums.
int add(int val) Adds a new test score val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the pool of test scores so far.
 

Example 1:

Input:
["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
[[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]

Output: [null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]

Explanation:

KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2]);
kthLargest.add(3); // return 4
kthLargest.add(5); // return 5
kthLargest.add(10); // return 5
kthLargest.add(9); // return 8
kthLargest.add(4); // return 8

Example 2:

Input:
["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
[[4, [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 3]], [2], [10], [9], [9]]

Output: [null, 7, 7, 7, 8]

Explanation:

KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(4, [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 3]);
kthLargest.add(2); // return 7
kthLargest.add(10); // return 7
kthLargest.add(9); // return 7
kthLargest.add(9); // return 8
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 104
1 <= k <= nums.length + 1
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
-104 <= val <= 104
At most 104 calls will be made to add.

# Thought Process

Use a minheap to keep the k largst element. For each dequeue an element if it's largest than the new one. 

# Complexity

The time complexity remains O(log k) for each Add operation.

The space complexity is O(k), as we only ever keep at most k elements in the heap.
