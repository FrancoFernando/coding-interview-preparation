# Description

You are given a 0-indexed integer array piles, where piles[i] represents the number of stones in the ith pile, and an integer k. You should apply the following operation exactly k times:

Choose any piles[i] and remove floor(piles[i] / 2) stones from it.
Notice that you can apply the operation on the same pile more than once.

Return the minimum possible total number of stones remaining after applying the k operations.

floor(x) is the greatest integer that is smaller than or equal to x (i.e., rounds x down).

Example 1:

Input: piles = [5,4,9], k = 2
Output: 12
Explanation: Steps of a possible scenario are:
- Apply the operation on pile 2. The resulting piles are [5,4,5].
- Apply the operation on pile 0. The resulting piles are [3,4,5].
The total number of stones in [3,4,5] is 12.
Example 2:

Input: piles = [4,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: Steps of a possible scenario are:
- Apply the operation on pile 2. The resulting piles are [4,3,3,7].
- Apply the operation on pile 3. The resulting piles are [4,3,3,4].
- Apply the operation on pile 0. The resulting piles are [2,3,3,4].
The total number of stones in [2,3,3,4] is 12.
 

Constraints:

1 <= piles.length <= 105
1 <= piles[i] <= 104
1 <= k <= 105

# Thought Process

The idea is to simulate the process of greedely pick the greatestPile and renoving stones from it.
A max heap is the perfect data structure for this.

# Complexity

The time complexity is O(n log n + k log n), where n is the number of piles:
- O(n log n) for building the initial heap
- O(k log n) for k operations on the heap
- 
The space complexity is O(n) for the heap.
