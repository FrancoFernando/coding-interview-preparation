# Dynamic Programming

## Overview

Dynamic programming (DP) is an optimization technique that solves complex problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computation.

## Key Concepts

- **Optimal Substructure**: Optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems
- **Overlapping Subproblems**: Same subproblems are solved multiple times
- **Memoization**: Top-down approach with caching (recursion + memo)
- **Tabulation**: Bottom-up approach with iterative filling

## Common Patterns

1. **Linear DP** - 1D state (Fibonacci, climbing stairs)
2. **Grid DP** - 2D state (unique paths, min path sum)
3. **String DP** - LCS, edit distance, palindromes
4. **Knapsack** - 0/1, unbounded, subset sum
5. **Interval DP** - Matrix chain, burst balloons
6. **State Machine DP** - Stock problems, state transitions

## Approach

1. Define the state (what subproblem are we solving?)
2. Define the recurrence relation
3. Identify base cases
4. Determine computation order
5. Optimize space if possible
