# Thinking Process 

1. DFS approach. Execute preorder dfs going right first and keeping the current subtree height. If no node has been 
   already included for the current height include it.  

2. BFS approach. Same as before. Include the last node of each level.

# Complexity

* O(N) time to traverse all nodes
* O(N) space for recursion stack or queue
