# Thinking Process 

1. Since problem ask to validate stack sequences use a stack to simulate. Basic observation is that an item cannot be popped 
   if has not been pushed befor. So if the current popped item is not on top of the stack continue to pus until it is. At the end all the item needs to be popped from the stack.

# Complexity (approach 1)

* O(N) time
* O(N) space
