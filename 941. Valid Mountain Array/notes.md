# Thinking Process 

It's a simulation problem to solve with brute force. A simple way to solve could be to find the peak value and validate that 
- all the preeceding values are strictly increasing
- all the following values are strictly decreasing

This reuires multiple passes, but simplify the code.

# Complexity (approach 1)

* O(N) time
* O(1) space
