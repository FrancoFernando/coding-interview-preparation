# Description

Given an integer array arr, count how many elements x there are, such that x + 1 is also in arr. If there are duplicates in arr, count them separately.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]
Output: 0
Explanation: No numbers are counted, cause there is no 2, 4, 6, or 8 in arr.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 1000
0 <= arr[i] <= 1000
