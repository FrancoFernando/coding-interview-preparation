# Thinking Process 

1. Hashmap to map each char to its keyboard index. Clarification: no circular buffer like computation. The distance
   between the first and the last chars in the keyboard is always the keyboard lenght, so abs can be used.

   

# Complexity (approach 1)

* O(N) time.
* O(1) space, because the alphabet size is constant.
