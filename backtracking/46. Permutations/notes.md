# Description

Given an array nums of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: [[1]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 6
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
All the integers of nums are unique.

# Thought process

Given a position in the permuted array, each number of the input that has not been already used can be put in that position.
The idea is to use backtracking to put an input number in a position, mark it as already used and move to the next position.
