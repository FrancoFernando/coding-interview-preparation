# Description

Given an integer array nums, return true if there exists a triple of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]. If no such indices exists, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Any triplet where i < j < k is valid.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: No triplet exists.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,1,5,0,4,6]
Output: true
Explanation: The triplet (3, 4, 5) is valid because nums[3] == 0 < nums[4] == 4 < nums[5] == 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you implement a solution that runs in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity?

# Description

The idea is to iterate the input and use two variables:

- first which keeps track of the smallest number seen so far.
- second which keeps track of the smallest number that is greater than first.
If we find a number greater than second, we have found an increasing triplet.

# Complexity

The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).
