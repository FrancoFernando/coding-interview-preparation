# Thinking Process 

The idea is to terate over the string and mark each character as found in a boolean array. Then che k if all the markers are true.
Building a hashset with the input string simplify the implementation.

# Complexity

* O(N) time to iterate through the input
* O(L) space where L is the alphabet lengths
