# Thinking Process 

1. Since all possible string permutations are required brute force can be applied here. Use recursion.
   If a character is a letter try both combinations: upper and lower.


# Complexity (approach 1)

* O(2^N) time, since for each character we need to explore 2 possibilities. So for N characters is 2*2*2*..2 = 2^N
* O(N) space for the recursion stack
