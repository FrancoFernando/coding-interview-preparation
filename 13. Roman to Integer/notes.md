# Thinking Process 

1. The only cases to take into account are the ones where subtraction happen. Looking at this better, in those case the value corresponding to the symbol can be considred as negative instead of positive. So just iterate the string and look for subtraction cases.

# Complexity (approach 1)

* O(N) time to iterate through the string
* O(1) space, since the map symbol to num is constant
