# Thinking Process 

Two pointer methods. The left pointer move to the right, the right pointer to the left. 
At each step the pointer identifying the higher integer in absolute value moves.
It's important to consider test case with all negative values.

# Complexity (approach 1)

* O(N) time to move the pointers
* O(1) space
