# Intuition

Odd/even positions can be moved over odd/even positions with cost 0.

Odd/even positions can be moved over even/odd positions with cost 1.

# Approach

Count number of odd and even position and return the minimum

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(N), need to traverse the positions array

- Space complexity: O(1)

# Code

```
class Solution:
    def minCostToMoveChips(self, position: List[int]) -> int:

        odd_count = sum(1 for pos in position if pos % 2 != 0)
        even_count = len(position)-odd_count
        return min(even_count, odd_count)
```
