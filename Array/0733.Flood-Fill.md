# Intuition
The matrix should be treated as a graph and traversed changing the current pixel color to the target color. The traversal continues until the current pixel is different from the starting color. 

# Approach
Implement dfs taking into account that if the current pixel has already the target color the traversal should never starts.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(MN)

- Space complexity: O(1)

# Code
```
class Solution:
    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        starting_color = image[sr][sc]
        if starting_color == color:
            return image

        def outOfImage(row, col):
            return row >= len(image) or col >= len(image[0]) or row < 0 or col < 0

        def dfs(row, col):
            if not (outOfImage(row, col) or image[row][col] != starting_color):
                image[row][col] = color
                dfs(row+1, col)
                dfs(row-1, col)
                dfs(row, col+1)
                dfs(row, col-1)

        dfs(sr, sc)
        return image
