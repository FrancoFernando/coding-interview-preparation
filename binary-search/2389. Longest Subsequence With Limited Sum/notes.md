# Description

You are given an integer array nums of length n, and an integer array queries of length m.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to queries[i].

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,2,1], queries = [3,10,21]
Output: [2,3,4]
Explanation: We answer the queries as follows:
- The subsequence [2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 3. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[0] = 2.
- The subsequence [4,5,1] has a sum less than or equal to 10. It can be proven that 3 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[1] = 3.
- The subsequence [4,5,2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 21. It can be proven that 4 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[2] = 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,4,5], queries = [1]
Output: [0]
Explanation: The empty subsequence is the only subsequence that has a sum less than or equal to 1, so answer[0] = 0.
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
m == queries.length
1 <= n, m <= 1000
1 <= nums[i], queries[i] <= 106

# Thought Process

For a subsequence, the order of the element doesnn't matter -> sort the input
Sorting the input allow to take smaller elements first which maximize the subsequence length
Binary search can speed up each query

# Complexity

Time complexity is (O(n log n + m log n), where n is the length of nums and m is the length of queries (sorting + m queries in log time).
Space complexity is O(n) for the prefix sum array.
